Thirty-three minutes later, after attaining an altitude of 33,000 feet, it was observed on radar in an extremely rapid descent. The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots. The descent continued to 16,700 feet after which the aircraft climbed to 24,000 ft.   After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the Atlantic Ocean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer's flight control inputs which caused the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean.

The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser.\nIn this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle\nand then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers.\nThe former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle,\nand then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser.\nIt was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot\nto bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting\nforward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The\npilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to \nthe old procedure and got it wrong.
